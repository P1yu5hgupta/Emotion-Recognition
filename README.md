# Emotion-Recognition

Designed a complete environment to detect the emotions of the 
person coming in the frame of the camera using OpenCV for 
computer vision and deep learning for expression detection.This 
will be done by capturing the images frame by frame and then 
passing the image through the trained model.


Dataset Used:

FER2013 dataset is used in training the model. The data consists 
of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been 
automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered 
and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. 
The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown 
in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1
=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
